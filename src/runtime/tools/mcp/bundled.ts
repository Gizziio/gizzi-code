/**
 * Bundled MCP Servers
 *
 * These MCP servers ship out of the box with all allternit products.
 * They are always available without user configuration, mirroring how
 * Claude Code bundles first-party MCP tools.
 *
 * Bundled servers:
 *   - sequential-thinking  (@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking)
 *   - context7             (@upstash/context7-mcp)
 *   - superpowers          (tools/mcp-servers/superpowers)
 *
 * These are merged with user-defined MCP config at startup. User config
 * can override any bundled server by defining an entry with the same key.
