/**
 * Dev preload: intercepts @opentui/solid/jsx-runtime imports.
 *
 * @opentui/solid ships only a .d.ts for its jsx-runtime subpath — no JS.
 * Bun injects `import { jsx } from "@opentui/solid/jsx-runtime"` on every
 * .tsx file (driven by tsconfig jsxImportSource). Since babel-preset-solid
 * already transforms all JSX into createComponent/h calls, these stubs are
 * never actually invoked — they just need to resolve so Bun doesn't crash.
