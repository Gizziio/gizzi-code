# Allternit API + Routing Overhaul Spec

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-03-15
**Status:** Planning — not yet built
**Related:** `Allternit_SDK_SPEC.md`

---

## Problem Statement

The Hono server currently has 21+ route groups that grew organically as features
were added. The SDK was generated from those routes after the fact. This created:

- Routes named by implementation detail, not by consumer intent
- No clear versioning on routes — breaking changes have no version boundary
- SDK surface and route surface are misaligned (SDK has more stubs than real routes)
- No consistent error response shape across routes
- Event emission is ad-hoc — some state changes emit events, some don't

The overhaul makes the **SDK surface the contract**. Routes exist to serve what
the SDK exposes, not the other way around.

---

## Design Principles

1. **SDK-first routing.** Every route group maps 1:1 to an SDK resource.
   If the SDK has `sdk.sessions`, there is a `/v1/session` route group.
2. **Versioned.** All routes under `/v1/`. Future breaking changes go to `/v2/`.
   Routes never change their response shape without a version bump.
3. **Consistent response envelope.** Every route returns the same shape:
   ```json
   { "data": <payload> }          // success
   { "error": { "code": "SESSION_NOT_FOUND", "message": "..." } }  // error
   ```
4. **Every state change emits an event.** Session created → `session.created` event.
   Message completed → `message.completed` event. No exceptions.
5. **OpenAPI spec is generated from the routes, not handwritten.**
   Hono + Zod validators → OpenAPI spec → `types.gen.ts` → SDK types.

## Current Route Inventory (Organic)

```
/session          — session CRUD + actions
/tui              — TUI-specific state
/provider         — provider listing + auth
/config           — configuration
/project          — project operations (unclear scope)
/agent            — agent CRUD
/global           — global state (unclear)
/mcp              — MCP server management
/permission       — permission checking
/instance         — instance lifecycle
/app              — app-level: agents, skills, log
/event            — SSE event subscription
/file             — file search
/auth             — auth operations
/cron             — cron job scheduling
/verification     — verification system
/skill            — skills
/ars-contexta     — knowledge graph + insights
/web-proxy        — proxies to web UI
/experimental     — experimental features
/user             — user info
```

Problems: `/global`, `/project`, `/tui`, `/app` have unclear boundaries.
`/event` works but isn't documented. `/experimental` is a catch-all.

## Target Route Structure

```
/v1/
├── session/          — Session CRUD + actions
├── agent/            — Agent CRUD + ACP
├── provider/         — Provider listing + auth flows
├── memory/           — L1/L2 memory access
├── cron/             — Cron scheduling
├── skill/            — Skills
├── verification/     — Verification + certificates
├── mcp/              — MCP server management
├── file/             — File search + read
├── config/           — Configuration
├── instance/         — Instance lifecycle + sync
├── event/            — SSE subscription (SSE, not JSON)
└── user/             — User info (Clerk)
```

`/ars-contexta` stays as-is — it's an external service proxy, not a first-party resource.
`/web-proxy` stays as-is — utility, not part of the platform contract.
`/experimental` is dissolved — features either graduate to a proper route or are removed.

## Response Envelope

Every route returns:

```typescript
// Success
{ "data": T }

// Error
{
  "error": {
    "code": string,         // Allternit error code (see SDK error taxonomy)
    "message": string,      // Human-readable
    "details"?: unknown     // Optional structured details
  }
}
```

HTTP status codes:
- `200` — success
- `201` — created
- `400` — bad request (validation failure, wrong params)
- `401` — auth required
- `403` — permission denied
- `404` — resource not found
- `409` — conflict (session busy, etc.)
- `500` — internal error

---

## Event Emission Contract

Every route that mutates state MUST emit the corresponding event on the GlobalBus
before returning the response. This is enforced via middleware.

```typescript
// Middleware pattern
app.post("/v1/session", async (c) => {
  const session = await Session.create(...)
  GlobalBus.emit({ type: "session.created", sessionID: session.id, session })
  return c.json({ data: session }, 201)
})
```

The SSE `/v1/event` route subscribes to GlobalBus and forwards all events.
Every surface that subscribes to `/v1/event` gets every state change in real-time.

---

## OpenAPI Spec Generation

The Hono routes + Zod validators automatically produce an OpenAPI spec via the
existing `/doc` route. This spec is the source of truth for:

1. `types.gen.ts` in the SDK (run `sdk:build` after server changes)
2. API documentation
3. Type validation in tests

**Workflow:**
```
Edit Hono route + Zod schema
    ↓
Server generates updated /doc (OpenAPI JSON)
    ↓
bun run sdk:build
    ↓
types.gen.ts updated
    ↓
TypeScript surfaces see type errors if they use removed/changed fields
    ↓
Fix surface code before shipping
```

---

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1 — Add `/v1` prefix, keep old routes (no breaking change)
- Add Hono route group `/v1/`
- Duplicate existing route logic under `/v1/`
- SDK points to `/v1/` routes
- Old routes still work (backward compat for raw-HTTP surfaces)

### Phase 2 — Consolidate scattered routes
- Merge `/app/agents` → `/v1/agent`
- Merge `/app/skills` → `/v1/skill`
- Merge `/global` + `/tui` into `/v1/instance/sync`
- Clarify and migrate `/project` scope

### Phase 3 — New routes for missing Allternit resources
- Add `/v1/memory` (L1/L2)
- Add `/v1/verification` (expose existing verification system)
- Ensure all routes emit correct GlobalBus events

### Phase 4 — Deprecate old routes
- Return `Deprecation` header on old routes
- Remove old routes in next major server version

---

## What This Enables

Once this is done:
- Every SDK resource has a real route backing it
- OpenAPI spec is complete and accurate
- `types.gen.ts` reflects the full Allternit platform API
- Every surface gets the same typed access
- Adding a new resource = new route + SDK resource + auto-typed for all surfaces
- No more route drift between what exists and what's documented
